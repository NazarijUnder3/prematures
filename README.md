Object of research: the process of predicting neurological disorders in preterm
infants.
The purpose of the thesis: building a prototype system for analyzing data on
premature babies to predict the presence of neurological disorders.
Methods of work: theoretical analysis of technical literature on research,
analysis of the subject area, practical modeling, creation of a DBMS code, creation of
a script for building a model, creation of visual reports, development of a Shiny web
application.
In the course of the thesis, various approaches to database modeling, building a
forecasting model were considered. A business analysis of the subject area
(medicine) was performed. Modeled and developed a relational type database of the
3rd normal form. The data has been loaded into the target database. Reports
visualizing data from the database have been built. A model for predicting
neurological disorders in preterm infants was developed, trained, and tested using
logistic regression to classify cases. A Shiny web application has been created that
allows you to interactively use the resulting model. A strategy for the further
development of the system has been developed.
The result of the work is the developed model for predicting premature babies
neurological disorders.
Application area: medicine.
